## Brief
Develop an application with a Natural User Interface. There are a number of options available to
you and this is an opportunity to combine a lot of technology that you have worked with over the
past four years.

## Project OverView
Our project will involve the leap motion controller and having it connected with the arduino board using a Node JS library running some commands which will in turn lead to us using some hand gestures on the leap motion and being able to then send a signal to a circuit board with some led lights pinned to it which will ommit a colour for a certain gesture.

## Research
We a great choice of technologies to use for this project from our Gesture Based UI module. We used different technolgies during our labs in order to gain a small amount of knowledge as to how they work and also to give us some ideas for use in our project. The college had a range of tech that we could have used for example they had [Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) , [Myo Armband](https://www.myo.com/) , and [Leap motion Controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/). We both had decided before any research that we would either be using raspberry pi and arduino or just arduino for our project as we both an in interest in the tech and wanted to use one of them in a project to gain some knowledge on them. As students we didn't want to invest too much on these tech as we can't afford too, so the arduino with the leap motion(which we can use from the college) was our best idea.

### First Idea
- Our first idea we thought out was using an arduino and having a camera plugged into it and by using this camera we would be able to recognise some different hand gestures or movements.

### Second Idea
After more research and learning about how the Leap Motion works we decided to go down a different path. We would be keeping our arduino but get rid of the camera plugin and instead use a breadboard for our lights while our Leap Motion would be detecting our hand gestures.
