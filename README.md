## Brief
Develop an application with a Natural User Interface. There are a number of options available to
you and this is an opportunity to combine a lot of technology that you have worked with over the
past four years.

## Project OverView
Our project will involve the leap motion controller and having it connected with the arduino board using a Node JS library running some commands which will in turn lead to us using some hand gestures on the leap motion and being able to then send a signal to a circuit board with some led lights pinned to it which will ommit a colour for a certain gesture.

## Research
We a great choice of technologies to use for this project from our Gesture Based UI module. We used different technolgies during our labs in order to gain a small amount of knowledge as to how they work and also to give us some ideas for use in our project. The college had a range of tech that we could have used for example they had [Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) , [Myo Armband](https://www.myo.com/) , and [Leap motion Controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/). We both had decided before any research that we would either be using raspberry pi and arduino or just arduino for our project as we both an in interest in the tech and wanted to use one of them in a project to gain some knowledge on them.
